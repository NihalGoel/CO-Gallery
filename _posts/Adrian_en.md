# Adrian Sauer

(b. 1976 DE, lives in Leipzig, DE)

Artist Adrian Sauer creates both visual works and textual works examining the medium of photography as a part of his practice. Until now, his textual pieces have been presented as poster installations and auditory sound pieces. This textual work commissioned by C/O Berlin brings together his own thoughts as well as researched materials on the topic of clouds from “About this text” to “Weather.” The effect of weather on photographs is just as relevant as human-influenced climate change and the technological cloud. Seen together, the thirty commentaries on photographic technologies, weather, and IT show a spectrum of perspectives of the ephemeral phenomenon of the cloud. The terms are organized in a form resembling digital hyperlinks, a text form that follows a networked structure rather than a linear one, yielding cross-references between the different entries. **Designed as** a digital glossary, the piece accompanies the themes of **the exhibition** [<u>“Songs of the Sky. Photography and the Cloud”</u>](https://co-berlin.org/en/program/exhibitions/songs-sky), which can be seen at [<u>C/O Berlin</u>](https://co-berlin.org/en) in the Amerika Haus from 11 December 2021 to 21 April 2022.
