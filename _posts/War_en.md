During the First World War, Arnold Schoenberg attempted to draw parallels be- tween the events of the war and meteorological phenomena in his “cloud diary.” He believed that supernatural powers exerted a significant influence on both the war and the weather. After some time, when he failed to establish a clear connection, he stopped making diary entries. He resumed toward the end of the war as means of reacting to his horror.-!28!-
