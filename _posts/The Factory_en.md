title: 'The Factory'
---

Huge clouds can sometimes be seen rising from the cooling tower of the power plant near Leipzig. We used to jokingly tell the children that there was a cloud factory there. **This came** to mind when I read the words of Bertolt Brecht: “The situation has become so complicated because the simple ‘reproduction of reality’ says less than ever about reality. A photograph of the Krupp works or the AEG reveals almost nothing about these institutions. Reality as such has slipped into the domain of the functional. The reification of human relations, the factory, for example, no longer discloses these relations.”14 **Here, Brecht** keeps the invisible elements of the present in mind. **We are** now aware of the unimaginably extreme influence that industrialization has had on our climate, in the past as well as the present. It’s almost impossible to picture. And photography seems entirely unable to depict the correlation between the two.-!14!-
