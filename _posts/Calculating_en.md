“Can the universe be described fully in terms of information? If that were the case, a computer program could theoretically calculate our reality. The term ‘digital physics’ was first coined in response to the premise that the universe is a digital computer. Proponents of this theory, however, were not looking for evidence of a simulated reality. Instead, they were more concerned with the universe’s fundamental structure. Are individual units of data the smallest building blocks of the universe? So far, there is no conclusive evidence. But if there were, our world could be generated by computers.” -!5!-
