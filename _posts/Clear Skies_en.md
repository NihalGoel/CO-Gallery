“The first bomb could have hit Nagasaki. The visibility there was excellent, but the primary target, Hiroshima, and the city of Kokura, a third possible location, were obscured by heavy clouds. But suddenly the clouds over Hiroshima parted and the Enola Gay honed in on its target. Nagasaki was temporarily spared thanks to a stroke of meteorological luck, but only briefly: then the bomb fell there, too, sixty years ago today.”-!6!-
